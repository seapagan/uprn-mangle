This project is a (work in progress) tool to take the Ordnance Survey '[Address
Base Premium][abp]' data and mangle it into a more usable form.

The data is then loaded into a database and provided as an API (Using Django).
Finally, a Frontend web app (written in React JS) will allow searching this data
by address and return the UPRN and links for Google maps and OpenStreetMap.

- Backend and mangle scripts in [Django][django] (Python)
- Basic Frontend in [React][react] (JavaScript)

## Update 15th May 2024

THIS README IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING UPDATED as the Project is being
refactored (again!) to use `Poetry` for Python dependencies, and replace
`Django` by `FastAPI` for the Backend. The Frontend will remain in `React`.

The Installation instructions below will shorly be updated to reflect these
changes.

I am working to optimize the management command to mangle and import the CSV
files as it is massively memory-hungry - using the entire Scotland dataset as an
example, it will crash on less than 12GB (Physical + Swap) usable memory. This
memory use is a priority to fix, likely at the expense of further increasing the
time to process the files.

## Installation

On your local machine, you need a working copy of [Python][python] and
[Nodejs][nodejs]. I recommend you also set up a local VirtualEnv specific to
this application. For example, if you use [Pyenv][pyenv] (highly
recommended), you can use its inbuilt VirtualEnv feature. Then, Clone or
download the repository to your local machine and switch to this new directory.

## Database Setup

You will also need a PostgreSQL database set up, with a user, password, and
dedicated database, with the correct settings input to the `.env` file. The user
should have full access to the specified database; It is good practice to create
a specific Postgresql user that only has access to this database.

You can copy then rename the [.env.example](backend/.env.example) file to `.env`
and add your database connection settings.

```ini
# set up Database Users. We will be using Postgresql and this should already
# exist with the correct user and password
UPRN_DB_USER='mickey'
UPRN_DB_PASSWORD='mouse'
# actual database name for the UPRN data...
UPRN_DB_NAME='addressbase_db'
UPRN_DB_HOST='localhost'
UPRN_DB_PORT='5432'
# name of the table in the database that contains the UPRN data...
UPRN_DB_TABLE='addressbase'
```

## UPRN Data

The data used for this project comes from the `AddressBase Premium` ( noted as
`ABP` from now on) by [Ordnance Survey][os]. APB is a commercial product, but
you can apply for a **Data Exploration License** [here][osdel]. The DEL allows
you to test and use the data in a limited way.

I will assume you have a copy of ABP in **CSV** format for this App. Copy all
the individual CSV files into the `backend/data/raw-csv/` folder.

The data provided by Ordnance Survey is a bit of a mess; that was the original
inspiration for this project - to merge/prune/tidy them into a usable format for
development.

We also need several other data files that are provided for free by OS on their
[OpenData][opendata] pages :

  1. We need the '**BLPU UPRN Street USRN 11**' data from the `OS Open Linked
     Identifiers` dataset. Download this, unzip and place the CSV file in the
     `backend/data/cross-ref-csv/` folder.
  2. We need the **header files** for the ABP data; this allows us to parse the
     data automatically. The project already contains the latest header files as
     of June 2022, but if any changes cause the scripts to fail, you can
     download the latest from OS [here][headers]. Download this file and replace
     all the existing CVS files in the `backend/data/header-files/` folder with
     those  in the zip file
  3. Finally, run the following command to process the raw data and add it to
     the database: `python manage.py import_uprn`

Part 3 above can take a good long time and memory. I recommend you close any
applications you are not using and reboot your system before starting. If you
are developing remotely using VSCode Remote SSH or similar, close VSCode and run
from a plain terminal.

## Setup and run the Backend

   1. Change to the **backend** directory in your terminal and run `pip install
      -r requirements.txt`. This command installs all the required dependencies.
   2. Generate a new secret key, and add it to the `.env` file above. Go to
      <https://djecrety.ir/> to generate a good one.
   3. In the same terminal and still in the **backend** directory, run
      `python manage.py migrate`
   4. Finally, run `python manage.py runserver`

The Back-end API will now be available at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/`

## Setup and run the Frontend

   1. In a terminal, change to the **frontend** directory and run `yarn` or
      (`npm install` if you prefer. I will use Yarn throughout, you can
      substitute with NPM if that is your preference). This command installs all
      the needed React.JS dependencies.
   2. Once complete, run `yarn start` to run the frontend.

You can now access the Front-end at `http://localhost:3000`

Running the Backend/Frontend from your terminal is good enough for development,
but use standard practices to run and harden the system for any production use.
